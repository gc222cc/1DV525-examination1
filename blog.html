                <h2><strong>Nashville Real Estate Mogul Debuts Skyscraper Via A VR Planetarium</strong></h2>

                <p>If you’re not too familiar with the Nashville metropolitan area, then the name Tony Giarratana
                    probably won’t mean much to you. However, besides his possible relation to the Pokemon devil,
                    Giarratana is also a prolific Tennessee real estate developer. His latest project, the 505 apartment
                    tower, is being unveiled tonight in a truly unique way: via a virtual reality planetarium.

                    According to the Nashville Business journal, Giarratana will be showing off concept designs for the
                    505 tower by using the planetarium in Nashville’s Adventure Science Center to surround visitors with
                    immersive views of his proposed vision. Some 126 guests are invited — including Nashville’s last
                    four mayors — and will be treated to a virtual tour of the new apartment that will culminate in a
                    virtual fireworks display.</p>
                <img src="http://cdn.uploadvr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-09-at-4.12.03-PM.png">

                <p>
                    After the festivities, guests will have the opportunity to dive further into the 505 tower via a
                    litany of Oculus Rift and Gear VR setups in the foyer. These rigs will be specifically showing what
                    the views will be like atop the 505 — which is projected to become the second tallest building in
                    Nashville and the entire state of Tennessee.

                    The population of downtown Nashville has spiked by over 40% since 2012 and, according to census
                    data, around 85 people move relocate to the Nashville area every day. As a result, the Nashville
                    skyline has been continuously exploding over the past few years.</p>

                <p>
                    Giarratana is one of the primary developers bringing about these changes, but the advances that he
                    and his colleagues are making are not always welcome. Population growth has become a major hot
                    button issue for native Nashvillians, many of whom do not enjoy watching traffic intensify and rent
                    prices skyrocket in their once intimate city.

                    PR activations, like Giarratana’s at the planetarium, are par for the course when it comes to wooing
                    the movers and shakers of Nashville and setting the collective consciousness at ease for new
                    construction.

                    The 505 apartment tower will be 45 stories tall and is planned for a grand opening in December 2017.

                <h2><strong>GadgET: Android Attack</strong></h2>

                <p>It's a company that we had sadly written off when it came to mobile handsets, but then came the
                    milestone.

                    Long ago, almost at the beginning of the mobile phone era in India, almost every handset was from a
                    brand named Motorola. But slowly companies like Nokia, Sony Ericsson and the rest (read crappy
                    Chinese mobiles) conquered their space and threw them into an abyss of obscurity.


                    Then for a long time the only places where we saw the stylish M logo was in the wireless sets used
                    by cops and the iconic Moto Razr series which created a style statement that no other brand could
                    emulate. And apart from the Razr high point there are not many milestones that we can chart in their
                    course through the consumer devices market.

                    But now, years later, they have once again come up with a product that might end up as a redefining
                    point in this era of telecommunication. What's that? The Milestone, yeah that's exactly what this
                    mobile handset it is called!

                    TOUCH AND FEEL

                    Some people like it to be chunky, some like it sleek... What we have here is a solid looking device
                    which surprisingly has been designed in a very sleek manner. It feels so good to hold that we've
                    been carrying it in our hands ever since we got it! What we instantly liked about this phone was
                    that the sliding movements of its QWERTY pad seemed right on track without any unwanted creaky
                    noises or creaky movements. And at a time when most of the other brands are coming up with kiddish
                    looking plasticky phones Motorola has come up with a very distinguished and ever lasting design for
                    the Milestone. So the round one easily goes to Moto without any objection.

                    PERFORMANCE

                    Now comes the most important part which decides the fate of any device. The most important thing is
                    that the Milestone is powered by the latest Android 2.1 operating system and that is what sets this
                    device apart from the rest. What that does is help us in multitasking in a way never imagined
                    before. Maps, browsing, playing around the screen with slight flicks and pinches; it lets you do all
                    this without a nano seconds lag in between.

                    Secondly unlike other operating systems this one takes the degree of customisation to an entirely
                    different level. Cause of its open source nature and the unlimited access to the platform developers
                    can come out with a wide range of apps which in turn means that we, the end users, get to goof
                    around with more and more of the craziest softwares ever.

                    FINAL VERDICT

                    Frankly the Milestone is the best Android powered handset we have ever used. In fact it might even
                    pose serious threat to the otherwise unchallenged regimen of the snobbish iPhone (yeah, even the
                    latest 3Gs version). But to be fair to the other handsets the Milestone is the first device to be
                    powered by the latest version of Android in India, so you surely can't really compare it with the
                    rest of the crop.

                    Overall with this kind of a package, viz... amazing build quality, snappy processing, a great set of
                    speakers and a pretty good 5 megapixels camera with a flash, image stabilisation, and DVD-quality
                    recording, it easily comes out as an unputdownable smartphone. Do we have the RIM and the rest of
                    the entertainment/prise handset makers brainstorming to come up with a worthy challenger?
